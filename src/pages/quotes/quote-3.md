title: "Good ideas"
quote: "But ideas aren't summoned from nowhere: they come from raw material, other ideas or observations about the world. Hence, a two-step creative process: collect raw material, then think about it. From this process, comes patterns recognition and eventually the insights that form the basis of novel ideas."
