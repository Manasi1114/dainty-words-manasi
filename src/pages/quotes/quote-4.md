quote: "The culture of a people is an ensemble of texts; themselves ensembles, which the anthropologist strains to read over the shoulders of those to whom they properly belong... Whatever the levels at which one operates the guiding principle is the same. Societies, like lives, contains their interpretations. One has only to learn how to gain access to them"
