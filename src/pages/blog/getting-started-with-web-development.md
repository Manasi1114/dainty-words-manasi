# Getting Started with Web Development

Web development can seem overwhelming at first, but with the right approach and tools, anyone can learn to build amazing websites. This guide will help you understand the fundamentals.

## The Building Blocks

Every website is built using three core technologies:

### HTML (Structure)

HTML provides the structure and content of your web pages. Think of it as the skeleton of your website.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Site</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### CSS (Styling)

CSS controls the visual presentation - colors, fonts, layout, and animations.

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 20px;
}

h1 {
  color: #333;
  text-align: center;
}
```

### JavaScript (Interactivity)

JavaScript adds interactive behavior to your websites.

```javascript
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
  const button = document.querySelector("button");
  button.addEventListener("click", function () {
    alert("Hello, World!");
  });
});
```
