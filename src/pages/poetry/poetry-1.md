So quiet it was in that high, sun-steeped room,<br>
So warm and still,that sometimes with the light<br>
Through the great windows, bright with bottle-panes,<br>
There’d float a chime from clock-jacks out of sight, <br>
     Clapping iron mallets on green copper gongs.

But only in blown music from the town’s<br>
Quaint horologe could Time intrude . . . you’d say<br>
Clocks had been bolted out, the flux of years<br>
Defied, and that high chamber sealed away<br>
     From earthly change by some old alchemist.

And, oh, those thousand towers of Nuremberg<br>
Flowering like leaden trees outside the panes:<br>
Those gabled roofs with smoking cowls, and those<br>
Encrusted spires of stone, those golden vanes<br>
     On shining housetops paved with scarlet tiles!

And all day nine wrought-pewter manticores<br>
Blinked from their spouting faucets, not five steps<br>
Across the cobbled street, or, peering through<br>
The rounds of glass, espied that sun-flushed room<br>
     With Dürer graving at intaglios.

O happy nine, spouting your dew all day<br>
In green-scaled rows of metal, whilst the town<br>
Moves peacefully below in quiet joy . . .<br>
O happy gargoyles to be gazing down<br>
     On Albrecht Dürer and his plates of iron!
