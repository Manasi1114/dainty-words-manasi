People who live earnestly
Are they happier? Are they quieter?
Are they paragons of goodwill?
Or
Are they dementors? Painhandlers?
    Narrowly escaped from hell.

They know when to shut up and listen
They discern the scent of flowers unseen
Autumn leaves fight to hit their feet
Birds chirping the morning breeze
    Secretly nod as they leave their seat.

Those who hold this particular gift
Are indeed as they intent
Upon this abundant green earth
    Swaying on the see-saw as they see fit.
