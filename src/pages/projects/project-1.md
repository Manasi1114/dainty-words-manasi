Markets in a country as diverse as India are often hailed as epitomes of cultural and social variations with their rich ancestral histories, combined with regional and modern identities. They are also a great place to observe and evaluate the richness of cultural and symbolic dimensions through the lens of commerce and ritualistic human behaviour. Apart from the seemingly unwieldy operation that is the Indian Market, the people milling about within the chaos of a too small boundary provides one with a unique perspective that can only come through spending an extended period of time observing and engaging with the market.

The objective of this report was to study such an Indian Market, moving beyond its economic functions and analyzing our ethnographic learning to understand the social relationships, spatial dynamics and various aesthetics that define its operation.
The primary object of focus at the market is the seasonal delicacy of Ponk. Also called Sorghum and Hurda, Ponk is green immature Jowar. The Jowar we usually see is harvested a little later but Ponk is harvested when the seeds are still young in the months of November- December. In Gujarat, the Ponk season is more than a culinary experience, it is a social affair.

The Market
The market studied is the appropriately named Ponk Nagari market located in the Adajan gam, a north-western neighbourhood of Surat, across the river Tapi. Ensconced between a Shani temple, a tennis court, the river and a landfill, this area perfectly captures the semi-urban muddy aesthetic that one has come to associate with ever-developing Indian cities. The entry-point is a large billboard like gate with a driveway under the Sardar bridge and is fenced on the front side with barbed metal wires. There is a lot of parking space under the bridge where people park their bigger vehicles and two-wheelers are parked inside the market.

Upon entering the market, you are welcomed with the enticing smell of Ponk vadas getting freshly prepared on the left hand side, with the sound of Bollywood rhythms almost overpowering the entire area.
