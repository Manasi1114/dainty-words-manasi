You would not believe that web design can be such a fun experience. Bittersweet to see it come to its natural conclusion. The entire class is preparing for an exhibit at the moment. It amazes me everytime to see such a diverse group of people come together and create something collectively. <br><br>

 All of us are separate divs plunged together to make a complete picture.
